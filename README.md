# League of Legends Stats Tracker (Shio)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is my first project into web developement.

You can input the summoner (player) name of a player in League of Legends and it will display to you
the results of their 10 most recent games. The initial data that is displayed to the user are
the players summoner name, icon, current level, and information about their current ranking in Ranked
Solo / Duo queue.

For each match, you will immediately see if the player won or lost the match, the champion they played
their primary runes, summoner spells, KDA, and the roster of the two teams of the match (including
the summoners name and the icon of the champion they played).

Upon clicking the dropdown button, the user may view the full stats of each players performance in the
match including there names, champion, KDA, vision score, cs (creep score) and items built.

Inspiration was taken from the popular League stats tracker [op.gg](https://na.op.gg/).
